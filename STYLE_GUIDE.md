# Style Guide

- Type naming conventions:
  - Use PascalCase for most names
  - Use capitals for acryonyms (e.g., `OCXErrorHandler`, `HTTPStatusCode`)
- DO NOT use `else` statements unless necessary
- DO NOT do unnecessary destructuring of variables
- DO NOT use try/catch if it can be avoided
- AVOID try/catch where possible
- Prefer single word variable names where possible
- Use as many bun APIs as possible
